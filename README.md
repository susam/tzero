Tzero
=====

Tzero is an timeboxing manager for IRC channels.  This tool logs into
an IRC network as a client and functions as an IRC bot.  Users of the
channel may send bot commands like `,begin`, `,list`, `,mine`,
`,running`, etc. to manage and view their timeboxes.

Timeboxing is a time management technique that is believed to boost
productivity by limiting the time during which a task is supposed to
be completed.  A time box is a fixed period of time alloted for a task
or activity.  This tool lets users of an IRC channel start and manage
their timeboxes while they block off some time for productive work.

To see Tzero in action, join either of the two channels:

- [#tzero:libera.chat](https://web.libera.chat/#tzero)
- [#tzero:matrix.org](https://app.element.io/#/room/#tzero:matrix.org)

The first one is an IRC channel and the second one is a Matrix room.
Both channels are bridged together, so messages posted to one channel
are visible in the other.  There is an instance of Tzero running in
the IRC channel.  It is connected to the channel with the nickname
`t0`.  Send the command `,help` to the channel to see `t0` reply with
a usage help message.
