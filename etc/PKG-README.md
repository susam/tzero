Tzero is a simple IRC bot that lets users of IRC channels start and
manage timeboxes.  Channel users can use the services provided by this
bot to start timeboxes, list currently running timeboxes, list
completed timeboxes, etc.  The timeboxes could be helpful to block
time for some productive work.
